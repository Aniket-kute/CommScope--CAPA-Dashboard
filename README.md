# CommScope--CAPA-Dashboard

### The CAPA dashboard is a tool designed to provide real-time visibility into the severity and status of Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) across all locations and departments within CommScope.

<br>

The dashboard displays data in a user-friendly format, making it easy to identify areas of concern and track progress towards resolution. The dashboard shows a table of all the active CAPAs with columns indicating the department/location, severity level, status, open date and the due date. 

<br>

The severity level is color-coded for easy identification with red for high, yellow for medium and green for low. The status column shows the current status of the CAPA such as open, closed, in progress etc. The open date and due date columns show the date the CAPA was opened and the date it is due to be closed. The dashboard also provides the capability to filter and sort the data based on the different columns and also allows to drill-down to see more details of the individual CAPA
